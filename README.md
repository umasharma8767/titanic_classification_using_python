# Titanic_classification_using_python
Creating a Titanic survival classification system involves several steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.
The code provided is a simplified example of building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive or not, based on various features such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. Here's an overview of the key steps in the code:

Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries for data manipulation, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Load the Dataset: Load the Titanic dataset (train.csv) into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Preprocessing:
Drop irrelevant columns (PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin).
Handle missing values by filling in the median age and the most common embarked value.
Convert categorical features (Sex and Embarked) to numerical using Label Encoding.

Feature Engineering:
Create a new feature called FamilySize by combining the number of siblings/spouses (SibSp) and parents/children (Parch).

Model Training:
Define the features (X) and the target variable (y).
Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Initialize a Random Forest Classifier model.

Train the Model:
Train the Random Forest Classifier model using the training data (X_train, y_train).

Model Evaluation:
Make predictions using the trained model on the testing data (X_test).
Calculate the accuracy of the model's predictions using the true labels (y_test).

Feature Importance:
Retrieve feature importances from the trained Random Forest model.
Associate feature names with their corresponding importances.
Sort features by importance in descending order and print the results.

This code provides a basic framework for building a machine learning model to predict survival on the Titanic
